##  Abstract

​    ***Our project finish the work that <font  size=4, color="blue"> fixing the problems of three graphs in an article to make them show their intention better</font>***.

---

## 1. ```Introduction```

---

​    We using four images to show that <font color="blue">**more people choose to point takeaway and eat out, which result in the increase of plastic waste that are already out of the expected average**</font>.  And we use three pictures as arguments.

1. <img src="./picture/1.png" width="300" align=left>    
  * Good Point: This picture use line plot to visualize the information, so it not only show data intuitively, but also presents the trend.
  * Bad Point: Unfortunately, this picture gives multi-dimensional comparison, and according to the cognitive theory, it is not good for humans' working memory.
  * Improvements: We can separate the picture into other pictures and each picture only compare one thing different.

2. <img src="./picture/2.png" width="300" align=left>
  * Good Point: Absolute magnitudes are important for bar plot and this picture start from 0 fitting this rule.
  * Bad Point: However, this picture do not show enough about the relative magnitudes, which is the plot want to show.
  * Improvements: We can use line plot, or use lumpy profile. Also add the max number on the top of the bar may be another good idea.

3. <img src="./picture/3.png" width="300" align=left>    
  * Good Point: The picture use line chart to show the trend of data, and it can be known that the difference between two lines is becoming bigger and bigger.
  * Bad Point: But it is still not intuitive enough, because the picture want to show the difference instead of trend. Beside, the data is not complete.
  * Improvements: We can use area plot to re-show these data.

## 2. ```Background```

---

This part will show the background of the whole work

* **<font color="blue">Plastic will finally back to human</font>**

  Plastic takes 10 to 1,000 years to decompose into microplastics, which flow through groundwater into the sea. They return via the marine food chain to people. So reducing plastic waste is urgent. And the WWF urged the government to set a phaseout of all single-use plastic cultery by 2022.

* **<font color="blue">Eating takeaway contributes to plenty of plastic waste</font>**

  ![1](./picture/background1.jpg)

  This obviously shows the quantity and types of those plastic waste.

      And it is unbelievable that plastic waste accounts for 88%!

## 3. ```Event```

---

1. <font color="green">Plastic Waste Comes More</font>

   <img src="./picture/1.1.png" height="350" width="550"><font color="blue">Realized</font>

   The above picture is what we realized and blow one is what we improved. 
   The original picture gets the following questions:

   * Too much variable and not easy for people to understand
     ***And we improve those shortcomings with the following method:***
     
   * We use four chart and each picture only show one thing different. This is good for humans' working memory.

   * Beside, we raise the bottom of y-axis to make the contrast more clear.

   	<font color="red">Improved</font>

   

2. <font color="Blue">  Plastic Waste at Landfills in HK</font>

   <center class="half">
   	<img src="./picture/2.1.png" height="350" width="500">
       VS
   	<img src="./picture/2.2.png" height="350" width="450">
   </center>

   ​                                                              <font color="blue">Realized</font>                                                                                                     <font color="red">Improved</font>

   The left picture is what we realized and right one is what we improved. 

   The original picture gets the following questions:

   * The contrast is not enough

     ***And we improve those shortcomings with the following method:***

   * We use line plot to present the trend of quantity of plastic waste 

   * To make sure the trend is more clear, we raise the minimum value of the y-axis.

     

3. <font color="orange"> HK MSW Reduction</font>

   <center class="half">
   	<img src="./picture/3.1.png" height="350" width="500">
       VS
   	<img src="./picture/3.2.png" height="350" width="500">
   </center>

   ​                                                       <font color="blue">Realized</font>                                                                                                                          <font color="red"> Improved</font>

   The left picture is what we realized and right one is what we improved. 

   The original picture gets the following questions:

   * Data Missing

   * line plot is not good for showing difference

     ***And we improve those shortcomings with the following method:***

   * We use area plot to present the increasing distance.

   * Since we can not find the complete data through the official website, we have to throw away the data after 2018.

---

## 4. ```Reveal```

---

* **Graphical Type**

  A good type of graph can help people understand more about the idea that one wants to express. For example,  the area plot is more suitable for third picture

* **Graphical Integrity**

  A good graph should not use multiple dimension, and not imply unintended text. Also label is important. The first graph has two many dimensions, the second one should give some number.

* **Graphical Excellence**

  When we make a graph, how to make it easy for people to understand is important. The second do not show enough contrast, and the first graph is not kind to humans' working memory. 



## 5. ```Conclusion```

---

We have make change selected graphs to let them show better for their original meaning that the author what to express. But we do not think those pictures can greatly explain why limiting single-use plastic waste use in eating takeaway is urgent for HK, this is because those data do not show damage plastic waste has caused to HK's environment, and we want to realize it with more data. We believe that this is the most direct way to show thrust.
